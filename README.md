# Orangewood-Labs-Weekly-Summary
This includes weekly reports of my time as an ROS Intern at Orangewood Labs, starting from 6th June.
 Do note that the summary before 4 July isn't created, because I was creating code summary for AGV and ARM robots. I didn't see the point in making a summary of a summary
